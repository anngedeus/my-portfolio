                science student with a minor in digital arts at the University of Florida. <br/>
                I was in raised in Croix-des-bouquets, Haiti and moved to the United States <br/>
                in July of 2016 to start High School. My first introduction to STEM was when <br/>
                I joined Girls of Distinction, an after school program aimed at getting young black girls <br/>
                into the STEM fields. Joining this program made me realize my passion for innovation <br/>
                and my continual drive to learn about technology. Additionally, this made me realize <br/>
                the importance of these programs for underrepresented groups into the STEM fields. <br/>
                I'm constantly finding ways to expand my CS knowledge whether it is through undergraduate <br/>
                <span><NavLink to="Research" target="_blank" className={classes.research}> research</NavLink></span> and engineering clubs.
